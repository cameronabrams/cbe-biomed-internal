\frametitle{The concept of simulation}

Simulations are representations of reality providing a \textcolor{red!80!black}{carefully proscribed extension of cognition}. They comprise:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Degrees of freedom; and
    \item Laws of interaction and change.
\end{itemize}

Why do we perform simulations?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Curiosity: If I change $X$, does $Y$ also change?  Why?
    \item Quantity: There are a lot of $X$'s; which ones matter? Why?
\end{itemize}
