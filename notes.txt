Why do we simulate reality?
  - experimental curiosity: if I change X, what is a likely or plausible response in Y

Are simulations "cost-effective"?  NO!
  - Simulations cannot replace experiments.  
  - Often, simulations suggest MORE experiments than an experimentalist would otherwise perform.

Simulation: representation of reality 
  - degrees of freedom 
  - laws of interaction and change

Physical simulations:
  type               |  degrees of freedom      |  laws
  quantum mechanical |  electons and nuclei     |  Schrodinger's equation
  classical          |  atoms as point masses   |  Newtonian mechanics
  continuum          |  volume elements/points  |  Continuum mechanics

Statistical Mechanics:  Observations as averages over microstates

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations: The most popular biomolecular simulation method

Why is MD always "wrong"?  The curse of unattainable ergodicity

NE VER THE LESS

What kinds of things can molecular simulations do in the biosciences?
  - suggest atomic models that fit low-resolution data
  - estimate effects of point mutations (Alchemical free energy); drug-target, protein-protein
  - screen potential interaction partners (docking/scoring)
  - model mechanisms to generate hypotheses (ion channels, enzymes, gas carriers) (rare event/free energy methods)
  - provide "first-principles-based" estimates of some equilibrium observables that can compare to experiments

What can't molecular simulations do?
  - predict 3D structures from 2D information alone
  - fully explain biomolecular mechanisms
  - fully predict protein thermodynamics (Tm, DG)
