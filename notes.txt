Why do we simulate reality?
  - experimental curiosity: if I change X, what is a likely or plausible response in Y
  - rapid iteration through many X's without "getting one's hands dirty"

Are simulations "cost-effective"?  NO!
  - Simulations cannot replace experiments.  
  - Often, simulations suggest MORE experiments than an experimentalist would otherwise perform.

Simulation: representation of reality 
  - degrees of freedom 
  - laws of interaction and change

Physical simulations:
  type               |  degrees of freedom      |  laws
  quantum mechanical |  electons and nuclei     |  Schrodinger's equation
  classical          |  atoms as point masses   |  Newtonian mechanics
  continuum          |  volume elements/points  |  Continuum mechanics

Statistical Mechanics:  Observations as averages over microstates

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations: The most popular biomolecular simulation method

Why is MD always "wrong"?  The curse of unattainable ergodicity

NE VER THE LESS

What kinds of things can molecular simulations do in the biosciences?
  - suggest atomic models that fit low-resolution data
  - estimate effects of point mutations (Alchemical free energy); drug-target, protein-protein
  - screen potential interaction partners (docking/scoring)
  - model mechanisms to generate hypotheses (ion channels, enzymes, gas carriers) (rare event/free energy/QMMM methods)
  - provide "first-principles-based" estimates of some equilibrium observables that can compare to experiments

What can't molecular simulations do?
  - predict 3D structures from 2D information alone
  - fully explain biomolecular mechanisms
  - fully predict protein thermodynamics (Tm, DG)

Why experimentalists seek out moleular simulations
  - you want a molecular-level perspective on the phenomena you study
  - your project will seem "deeper" to potential reviewers
  - you believe that structure and function are linked and that physical laws underly biology
  - you recognize that you have an incomplete toolset for generating testable hypotheses

What does it cost to add molecular simulations to your otherwise experimental project?
  - if *you* do it yourself:
    - you and your mentees must be trained; can take about a year just to get off the ground
      - Linux at the command-line
      - Remote access
      - Batch processing on shared resources
      - Production MD codes and analysis codes (NAMD, Gromacs, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Desmond, ...)
      - Data management
    - you have to secure computational resources; these are never free
      - your institution may have HPC resources (Drexel: URCF/Picotte)
      - you can buy time on Azure or AWS (very very expensive)
      - DoD/DoE funded?  You can get HPMCP/national-lab access -- talk to your PO.
      - ACCESS: NSF-funded consortium of HPC resources
  - if you recruit a collaborator
    - expect to fund 0.5 - 2.0 FTE researchers, depending on scope
    - expect to at least help in getting resources, especially if project is DoD or DoE funded
    - expect to have regular meetings to align research activities -- simulationists need a lot of input and feedback

What do simulationists do when they are not collaborating with experimentalists?
  - method development
