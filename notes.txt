Why do we simulate reality?
  - experimental curiosity; if I change X, what is the response of Y
  - we have "pictures" and structures, but we don't necessarily know how they respond and interact

Simulation: representation of reality 
  - degrees of freedom 
  - laws of interaction and change

Physical simulations:
  type               |  degrees of freedom      |  laws
  quantum mechanical |  electons and nuclei     |  Schrodinger's equation
  classical          |  atoms as point masses   |  Newtonian mechanics
  continuum          |  volume elements/points  |  Continuum mechanics

Statistical Mechanics:  Observations as averages over microstates

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations: The most popular biomolecular simulation method

What kinds of things can molecular simulations do in the biosciences?
  - fit atomic models to densities (MDFF)
  - estimate effects of point mutations
  - screen potential interaction partners
  - model mechanisms to generate hypotheses (ion channels, enzymes, gas carriers)
  - provide some equilibrium observables that can compare to experiments

What can't molecular simulations do?
  - predict 3D structures from 2D information alone
  - explain biomolecular mechanisms
